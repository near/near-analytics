# near-analytics

Analytics Tool for NEAR Blockchain.  
[NEAR Explorer](https://explorer.near.org/) uses it for [mainnet](https://explorer.near.org/stats) and [testnet](https://explorer.testnet.near.org/stats).

Raw data is available for your needs.

- testnet credentials: `postgres://public_readonly:nearprotocol@35.241.197.241/indexer_analytics_testnet`
- mainnet credentials: `postgres://public_readonly:nearprotocol@34.78.19.198/indexer_analytics_mainnet`

Keep in mind that the data (both format and the contents) could be changed at any time, the tool is under development.
